# Price Tracker for an item on Amazon

In this project, I have made a web scraping tool using urllib.request and Beautiful soup and library in Python. The tool checks the price of an item (I have chosen the item to be Apple Macbook Air M1) on a daily basis and when the price does go down it sends an email to the user alerting them that the price has decreased.
